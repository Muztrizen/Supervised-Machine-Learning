## Advantage of Decision Tree
* Decision trees can be used to predict both continuous and discrete values i.e. they work well for both regression and classification tasks.
* They require relatively less effort for training the algorithm.
* They can be used to classify non-linearly separable data.
* They're very fast and efficient compared to KNN and other classification algorithms.
