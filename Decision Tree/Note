## Advantage of Decision Tree
*Decision trees can be used to predict both continuous and discrete values i.e. they work well for both regression and classification tasks.
*They require relatively less effort for training the algorithm.
*They can be used to classify non-linearly separable data.
*They're very fast and efficient compared to KNN and other classification algorithms.
